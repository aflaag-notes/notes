# Nyx Template

Nyx Template is a minimal collection of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) packages and settings that ease the writing of beautiful documents. While originally meant for theses, it is perfectly suitable for project reports, articles, syntheses, etc. – with a few adjustments, like margins.

It is composed of four separate packages – `nyx-packages`, `nyx-title`, `nix-styles`,`nix-frames`, and `nix-macro` – each of which can be used individually (except for `nyx-packages`, which is a requirement for all other packages ).

For more information about the packages, settings, environments, commands, etc., please refer to the documentation file [`main.pdf`](main.pdf), which also acts as showcase document.
